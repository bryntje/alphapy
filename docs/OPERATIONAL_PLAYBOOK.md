# Operational Playbook

Quick checklist and verification steps after adding the bot to a new server.

## Related docs

- **Multi-guild configuration** (required channels, feature config): [configuration.md](configuration.md)
- **Reminders** (one-off vs recurring, embed watcher): [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) (EmbedReminderWatcher, ReminderManager)
- **Ticket system**: [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) and [configuration.md](configuration.md)

## Pre-flight checklist

- [ ] `DATABASE_URL` environment variable is set
- [ ] Bot has administrator permissions in the server
- [ ] All required channels exist and bot can read/send messages
- [ ] Bot can create channels and roles (for ticket system)

## Startup verification

After starting the bot, confirm in the logs:

- [ ] "DB pool created"
- [ ] "audit_logs table created/verified"
- [ ] "health_check_history table created/verified"
- [ ] "Command tracker: Database pool set"
- [ ] "Bot has successfully started and connected to X server(s)!"
- [ ] Guild enumeration with server names and IDs

## Testing functionality

### 1. Embed-driven reminder

- Post an embed in the announcements channel with date/time.
- Bot should detect it and schedule a reminder.
- Check `/config system show` to verify channel settings.

### 2. Manual reminder

- Use `/add_reminder`.
- Verify the reminder appears in the list and triggers at the correct time.
- Test `/reminder_edit` to modify it.

### 3. Import (owner only)

- Use `/import_onboarding` and `/import_invites` after configuring the required channels.
- Check `WATCHER_LOG_CHANNEL` for "created", "sent", and "deleted" log embeds.

### 4. Recurring reminder

- Create a recurring reminder (days + time).
- It should send only on the matching weekday at the configured time and not be deleted afterward.

### 5. Idempotency

- Restart the bot within the same minute window of a scheduled send.
- Verify only one send occurs (duplicates prevented via `last_sent_at`).

## Troubleshooting reminders

- **No sends?** Verify timezone is Brussels and system clock is correct.
- Check that `time` in the DB equals the intended trigger minute (HH:MM).
- Inspect `WATCHER_LOG_CHANNEL` for parsing or SQL errors.
- **Optional indexes** for performance:
  ```sql
  CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_reminders_time ON reminders (time);
  CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_reminders_reminder_date ON reminders ((event_time - interval '60 minutes')::date);
  ```
