# Database Schema Reference

Complete reference for all database tables used by the Alphapy Discord Bot.

## Overview

The bot uses PostgreSQL for persistent storage. Schema is managed via [Alembic migrations](migrations.md). All tables support multi-guild architecture via `guild_id` columns.

## Tables

### `bot_settings`

Guild-specific bot configuration settings.

**Columns:**
- `guild_id` (BIGINT, NOT NULL): Discord guild ID
- `scope` (TEXT, NOT NULL): Setting scope (e.g., "system", "reminders", "gpt")
- `key` (TEXT, NOT NULL): Setting key
- `value` (JSONB, NOT NULL): Setting value (stored as JSON)
- `value_type` (TEXT): Type of value (e.g., "channel", "bool", "int")
- `updated_by` (BIGINT): User ID who last updated this setting
- `updated_at` (TIMESTAMPTZ): Last update timestamp

**Primary Key:** `(guild_id, scope, key)`

**Indexes:** None (primary key provides efficient lookups)

---

### `settings_history`

Audit trail for settings changes.

**Columns:**
- `id` (SERIAL PRIMARY KEY)
- `guild_id` (BIGINT, NOT NULL)
- `scope` (TEXT, NOT NULL)
- `key` (TEXT, NOT NULL)
- `old_value` (JSONB): Previous value
- `new_value` (JSONB, NOT NULL): New value
- `value_type` (TEXT)
- `changed_by` (BIGINT): User ID who made the change
- `changed_at` (TIMESTAMPTZ): Change timestamp
- `change_type` (TEXT, NOT NULL): Type of change (e.g., "created", "updated", "deleted", "rollback")

**Indexes:**
- `idx_settings_history_guild_scope_key` on `(guild_id, scope, key)`
- `idx_settings_history_changed_at` on `changed_at`

---

### `reminders`

Scheduled reminders (recurring and one-off events).

**Columns:**
- `id` (SERIAL PRIMARY KEY)
- `guild_id` (BIGINT, NOT NULL)
- `name` (TEXT, NOT NULL): Reminder name
- `channel_id` (BIGINT, NOT NULL): Channel to send reminder to
- `time` (TIME): Reminder trigger time (T−60 for one-off, reminder time for recurring)
- `call_time` (TIME): Event display time (T0, what user sees)
- `days` (TEXT[]): Days of week (0=Mon..6=Sun); empty for one-off events
- `message` (TEXT): Reminder message content
- `created_by` (BIGINT): User ID who created the reminder
- `origin_channel_id` (BIGINT): Original channel where embed was detected
- `origin_message_id` (BIGINT): Original message ID
- `event_time` (TIMESTAMPTZ): One-off event timestamp (NULL for recurring)
- `location` (TEXT): Event location
- `last_sent_at` (TIMESTAMPTZ): Last send timestamp (for idempotency)
- `image_url` (TEXT): Optional image or banner URL (Premium feature)
- `sent_message_id` (BIGINT): Discord message ID of the T-60 offset reminder send; used to delete it when the T0 on-time reminder fires

**Indexes:**
- `idx_reminders_time` on `time`
- `idx_reminders_event_time` on `event_time`
- **Recommendation:** A composite index on `(guild_id, id DESC)` can speed up listing reminders by guild (e.g. reminder_list, add_live_session default channel resolution).

**Notes:**
- One-off events: `event_time` is set, `days` is empty
- Recurring events: `event_time` is NULL, `days` contains weekday numbers
- `time` is the reminder trigger time (T−60), `call_time` is the event time (T0)
- Premium: reminders with `image_url` require an active premium subscription for the creator

---

### `premium_subs`

Premium subscription status (local fallback when Core-API is unavailable). **One active subscription per user**; it applies to a single guild. Users can move it via `/premium_transfer` (or dashboard later).

**Columns:**
- `id` (SERIAL PRIMARY KEY)
- `user_id` (BIGINT, NOT NULL): Discord user ID
- `guild_id` (BIGINT, NOT NULL): Guild where Premium is active (can be updated for transfer)
- `tier` (TEXT, NOT NULL): `monthly`, `yearly`, `lifetime`

- `stripe_subscription_id` (TEXT): External subscription ID (for support/cancellation only)
- `expires_at` (TIMESTAMPTZ): NULL for lifetime or N/A
- `created_at` (TIMESTAMPTZ): When the record was created
- `expiry_warning_sent_at` (TIMESTAMPTZ, added migration 015): Timestamp of last 7-day expiry warning DM. NULL = no warning sent yet. Used by the `check_expiry_warnings` background task to avoid duplicate DMs.

**Indexes:**
- `idx_premium_subs_user_guild` on `(user_id, guild_id)`
- `idx_premium_subs_guild_status` on `(guild_id, status)`
- `idx_premium_subs_one_active_per_user`: unique on `(user_id)` WHERE `status = 'active'` (enforces one active per user)

**RLS (Supabase):** Row Level Security is enabled (migration 007). No policies are defined for `anon`/`authenticated`, so only the backend role (table owner / service role / superuser used by `DATABASE_URL`) can read or write. Direct Supabase client access with anon or authenticated keys sees no rows.

**GDPR:** This table stores only access-control data (user_id, guild_id, tier, status, optional external ID, expiry). No payment details, email, or other PII are stored here.

---

### `gpt_usage`

Per-user, per-guild daily GPT call tracking for quota enforcement. Added in migration 014.

**Columns:**
- `user_id` (BIGINT, NOT NULL): Discord user ID
- `guild_id` (BIGINT, NOT NULL): Discord guild ID
- `usage_date` (DATE, NOT NULL, DEFAULT CURRENT_DATE): The UTC date of usage
- `call_count` (INTEGER, NOT NULL, DEFAULT 0): Number of GPT calls made on this date

**Primary key:** `(user_id, guild_id, usage_date)`

**Indexes:**
- `idx_gpt_usage_date` on `usage_date` (for efficient cleanup of old rows)

**Notes:**
- `check_and_increment_gpt_quota()` in `utils/premium_guard.py` uses an atomic `INSERT … ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` so no race conditions
- Limits per tier: free = 5/day, monthly = 25/day, yearly/lifetime = unlimited (NULL)
- Only user-initiated GPT calls are counted; ticket summaries and embed watcher calls pass `user_id=None` and are excluded

**GDPR:** Stores only Discord user ID, guild ID, date, and a counter. No message content or PII beyond the snowflake ID.

---

### `terms_acceptance`

Tracks user acceptance of the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy for GDPR compliance.

**Columns:**
- `id` (SERIAL PRIMARY KEY)
- `user_id` (BIGINT, NOT NULL, UNIQUE): Discord user ID
- `accepted_at` (TIMESTAMPTZ, NOT NULL, DEFAULT NOW()): When the user accepted the terms
- `version` (TEXT, NOT NULL, DEFAULT '2026-03-02'): Legal terms version the user accepted

> **Note:** The `ip_address` column was dropped in migration 016. Discord gateway interactions carry no client IP, so the column was always NULL. Re-add it via a new migration only if a web-based consent flow is implemented.

**Indexes:**
- `idx_terms_acceptance_user` on `user_id`
- `idx_terms_acceptance_accepted_at` on `accepted_at`

**Notes:**
- Used by the `/premium` flow: users must accept terms before accessing premium checkout.
- Stores only minimal consent metadata for legal compliance; no content of the terms is stored here.

---

### `gdpr_acceptance`

Guild GDPR agreement acceptance (the "I Agree" button in the GDPR channel).

**Columns:**
- `user_id` (BIGINT, NOT NULL): Discord user ID
- `guild_id` (BIGINT, NOT NULL): Discord guild ID — scopes acceptances per server (added migration 018)
- `accepted` (INTEGER, NOT NULL, DEFAULT 0): 1 = accepted, 0 = not accepted
- `timestamp` (TIMESTAMP, NOT NULL, DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP): When the user clicked "I Agree"

**Primary Key:** `(user_id, guild_id)`

**Notes:**
- Written by `cogs/gdpr.py` / `utils/gdpr_helpers.py` when a user clicks the "I Agree" button on the GDPR embed
- Formalised in Alembic migration 016; `guild_id` column added in migration 018
- Deleted as part of GDPR erasure when a user's Supabase account is deleted (`webhooks/supabase.py:_purge_railway_data`) or when the user runs `/delete_my_data`

---

### `app_reflections`

Plaintext reflections received from the App via Core-API webhook. Used for Grok context in user-self flows (e.g. `/growthcheckin` only; not used for ticket "Suggest reply" for privacy). Consent is validated by Core before the webhook is sent; revoke is handled via `POST /webhooks/revoke-reflection`.

**Columns:**
- `id` (SERIAL PRIMARY KEY)
- `user_id` (BIGINT, NOT NULL): Discord user ID
- `reflection_id` (TEXT, NOT NULL): Unique reflection identifier from App/Core
- `plaintext_content` (JSONB, NOT NULL): Full reflection payload (e.g. reflection_text, mantra, thoughts, future_message, date)
- `created_at` (TIMESTAMPTZ, NOT NULL, DEFAULT NOW())

**Unique constraint:** `(user_id, reflection_id)` to prevent duplicates (upsert on conflict).

**Indexes:**
- `idx_app_reflections_user_created` on `(user_id, created_at DESC)` for chronological queries (e.g. last 30 days).

**Notes:**
- Populated by `POST /webhooks/app-reflections`; deleted by `POST /webhooks/revoke-reflection`.
- Context loader (`gpt/context_loader.py`) reads from this table for user-self flows (e.g. `/growthcheckin`). Ticket "Suggest reply" does not use reflection context.

**Grok context sources for `/growthcheckin` (all three are merged, max 5 total):**
1. Supabase `reflections_shared` — App reflections the user opted to share (requires `bot_sharing_enabled = true`)
2. Supabase `reflections` — Discord check-ins written by `/growthcheckin` itself (no opt-in required)
3. Railway `app_reflections` — plaintext from Core-API webhook (last 30 days, no opt-in required)

## Database Connection Architecture

The bot uses `asyncpg` connection pools for all database operations, providing:
- **Better concurrency**: Multiple operations can run simultaneously
- **Connection reuse**: Efficient resource management
- **Graceful error handling**: Automatic retry and recovery from connection errors
- **Event loop isolation**: Command tracker uses dedicated pool in bot's event loop

### Connection Pool Configuration

Each component manages its own connection pool with appropriate size limits:
- **FastAPI (`api.py`)**: Main pool for API endpoints (shared with bot)
- **Command Tracker**: Dedicated pool in bot's event loop (min_size=1, max_size=5)
- **Reminders Cog**: Pool for reminder operations (max_size=10)
- **Ticket Bot**: Pool for ticket operations (max_size=10)
- **FAQ Cog**: Pool for FAQ operations (max_size=5)
- **Embed Watcher**: Pool for embed parsing (max_size=10)
- **Other Cogs**: Individual pools as needed (typically max_size=5)
 - **Verification Cog**: Pool for verification ticket operations (max_size=10)

All pools include:
- Connection timeout handling
- Graceful shutdown on cog unload
- Error handling for connection failures
- Pool status checks before operations

## Schema Management

All schema changes are managed via Alembic migrations. See [migrations.md](migrations.md) for migration workflow.

**Current Migration:** `001_initial` (baseline)

To view current schema state:
```bash
alembic current
```

To apply migrations:
```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

---

## Multi-Guild Architecture

All tables that store guild-specific data include a `guild_id` column:
- `bot_settings`
- `settings_history`
- `reminders`
- `onboarding`
- `guild_onboarding_questions`
- `guild_rules`
- `support_tickets`
- `audit_logs`

Tables without `guild_id` are global:
- `ticket_summaries` (linked via `ticket_id` → `support_tickets` → `guild_id`)
- `ticket_metrics` (scope-based, not guild-specific)
- `faq_entries` (global knowledge base)
- `faq_search_logs` (analytics)
- `health_check_history` (system-wide)

---

## Indexes

All tables have appropriate indexes for common query patterns:
- Primary keys provide efficient lookups
- Foreign key columns are indexed where applicable
- Time-based columns have indexes for range queries
- Composite indexes support multi-column filters

---

## Data Retention

- **Health check history**: Auto-deletes records older than 30 days
- **Audit logs**: No automatic cleanup (can be configured per guild)
- **Ticket summaries**: No automatic cleanup
- **Other tables**: No automatic cleanup (manual maintenance recommended)

---

## Backup Recommendations

Regular backups should include:
- All tables (full database backup recommended)
- Focus on `bot_settings`, `reminders`, `support_tickets`, `onboarding` for critical data
- `audit_logs` and `health_check_history` can be excluded from frequent backups (analytics only)
