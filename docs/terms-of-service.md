# Innersync • Alphapy Bot Terms of Service

_Last updated: 2025-10-16_

Thank you for using the Innersync • Alphapy Discord Bot (“**Innersync • Alphapy**”, “**Bot**”, “**we**”, “**us**”, “**our**”). These Terms of Service (“**Terms**”) set out the rules that govern how you access and use the Bot and its related functionality. By inviting the Bot to a Discord server, configuring it, or interacting with any of its commands, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Bot.

> **Quick summary (not a substitute for the full Terms):** You must follow Discord’s rules and keep the Bot configured responsibly. Innersync • Alphapy is provided “as is”, without financial advice, and we may modify or remove features at any time. You are responsible for ensuring the Bot fits your community’s needs.

## 1. Eligibility and Accounts

- You must have a valid Discord account and comply with [Discord’s Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms) and [Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines).
- Server administrators who install the Bot confirm that they have the necessary rights to manage integrations for their Discord server.
- You must ensure that your members understand the nature of the Bot’s functionality, especially when it surfaces AI-generated content or captures member submissions.

## 2. Description of Service

Innersync • Alphapy offers modular features designed for community management and growth support. Current capabilities are described in `README.md` and may include:

- **Reminder tools**: automated reminders based on embeds, schedules, or manual input.
- **AI interactions**: Grok-powered commands such as `/learn_topic`, `/growthcheckin`, and `/create_caption`.
- **Ticketing and utilities**: invite tracking, moderation helpers, and export tools.
- **GDPR support**: commands to export onboarding data and future deletion tooling.

We may update, add, or remove features without prior notice. Some functionality may rely on third-party APIs (e.g., OpenAI, Discord, Google Cloud) and their availability.

## 3. Acceptable Use

When using the Bot, you agree to:

- Use the Bot only for lawful purposes and in compliance with applicable regulations (including GDPR if you process EU personal data).
- Configure roles, permissions, and channels responsibly to avoid exposing sensitive data.
- Avoid uploading or prompting the Bot with unlawful, offensive, or infringing content.
- Refrain from reverse engineering, attempting to extract proprietary source code, or misusing rate limits.
- Give members clear notice if their inputs will be stored or used for AI processing.

We reserve the right to suspend or decline service for misuse, security concerns, or legal obligations.

## 4. Data and Privacy

Your use of the Bot is also governed by the [Innersync • Alphapy Privacy Policy](./privacy-policy.md), which explains what data we collect, how we store it, and the choices available to you and your members. Installing or using the Bot signifies acceptance of that document.

## 5. Configuration Data and Member Content

- Server administrators are responsible for the accuracy of configuration settings (e.g., reminder channels, log channels, access roles).
- Growth check-in responses, ticket messages, reminder details, and similar content may be stored in a database to operate the features you enable.
- AI-generated suggestions or summaries are produced automatically. They may be inaccurate or unsuitable; always review before acting on them.
- If you submit third-party content through the Bot, you confirm you have the right to do so and grant us a non-exclusive license to process that content for the purpose of operating the Bot.

## 6. Financial and Educational Disclaimer

Innersync • Alphapy serves communities that discuss trading and personal growth. Nothing generated or surfaced by the Bot should be construed as financial, investment, legal, or mental-health advice. You act on any information at your own risk. Always consult qualified professionals before making decisions.

## 7. Availability and Support

- The Bot is provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis. We do not guarantee uninterrupted uptime.
- We may temporarily suspend the Bot for maintenance, security updates, or to comply with legal requirements.
- Support is offered on a best-effort basis via the contact methods listed below. Response times may vary.

## 8. Modifications to the Terms

We may revise these Terms when we update the Bot or our policies. Significant changes will be announced via the project’s changelog, repository releases, or other appropriate channels. Continuing to use the Bot after changes take effect constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.

## 9. Termination

- You may remove the Bot from your server at any time. Doing so stops new data collection but stored data may persist until deleted under the Privacy Policy.
- We may terminate or suspend your access if you violate these Terms, pose a risk to other users, or if we discontinue the Bot.

## 10. Intellectual Property

- The Innersync • Alphapy codebase is released under the MIT License (see `LICENSE` or `README.md`). Respect the license terms when forking or self-hosting.
- Innersync • Alphapy, related artwork, and documentation remain our intellectual property. Third-party trademarks remain the property of their respective owners.

## 11. Third-Party Services

Some features depend on external providers (such as Discord, OpenAI, Google Drive, and PostgreSQL hosting). Using those features means you also agree to the terms and privacy practices of those providers. We are not responsible for interruptions or issues caused by third-party services.

## 12. Disclaimer of Warranties

To the maximum extent permitted by law, we disclaim all warranties, express or implied, including warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. Use the Bot at your own risk.

## 13. Limitation of Liability

To the extent permitted by law, we shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits or revenues, whether incurred directly or indirectly, or any loss of data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses resulting from:

- Your access to or use of (or inability to access or use) the Bot;
- Any conduct or content of third parties on the Bot; or
- Unauthorized access, use, or alteration of your transmissions or content.

Our aggregate liability for any claim related to the Bot will not exceed €100.

## 14. Governing Law

These Terms are governed by the laws of Belgium, without regard to conflict-of-law principles. If you operate Innersync • Alphapy from a different jurisdiction, update this section before publishing.
