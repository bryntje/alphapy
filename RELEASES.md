## [3.7.0] - 2026-04-25 - "Enterprise Ready"

### Minor Release: API Observability, CI Quality Gates, and Engagement Stability

This release adds API request observability and idempotent reminder API writes, formalizes migration-driven startup, and improves challenge reliability in the engagement module.

#### What's New
- **API observability endpoint**: New internal `GET /api/observability` with rolling success rate, request volume, and latency percentiles (`p50`, `p95`, `p99`) for API and webhook traffic
  - Audience/scope: Mind/internal observability and ops monitoring (outside Alphapy dashboard configuration endpoints)
- **Request tracing**: API middleware now propagates `X-Request-ID` and tracks per-request latency/outcome
- **Reminder API idempotency**: `POST /api/reminders`, `PUT /api/reminders`, and `DELETE /api/reminders/{reminder_id}/{created_by}` now support `Idempotency-Key` headers
- **Migration 022**: Creates/ensures `audit_logs` and `health_check_history`, ensures analytics indexes, and adds `idx_reminders_event_time`
- **CI quality gates**: Added Ruff linting, Pyright type checking, and pytest coverage in `.github/workflows/bot.yml`
- **Tooling baseline**: Added `pyproject.toml` (Ruff/Pyright config), updated `pytest.ini` coverage defaults, and added `pytest-cov`, `ruff`, and `pyright` to `requirements.txt`

#### Reliability & Fixes
- **API startup schema behavior**: Removed runtime `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` from FastAPI lifespan; schema changes are now Alembic-driven
- **Security hardening mode**: Added strict startup checks in production when `STRICT_SECURITY_MODE=1` and required auth/webhook secrets are missing
- **CORS fallback**: Removed wildcard fallback and tightened default fallback to localhost-only development origins
- **Engagement challenge stability**: Fixed `NameError` crash in challenge finalization and corrected challenge progress after restart by rehydrating timestamps from DB

## [3.3.0] - 2026-04-12 - "Enterprise Ready"

### Minor Release: Verification Overhaul & Growth Check-in Improvements

This release completes the verification workflow with full admin controls and AI configurability, and ships growth check-in community sharing and history.

#### What's New
- **Verification — manual approve/reject**: `ManualReviewView` with admin Approve/Reject buttons posted when AI flags a screenshot for manual review; reject opens a modal for optional reason
- **Verification — reference image**: Admins can set a reference payment screenshot via `/config verification set_reference_image`; the AI compares both images on every submission
- **Verification — AI prompt context**: `/config verification set_ai_prompt_context` lets admins tell the AI what a valid payment looks like for their community
- **Verification — channel auto-delete**: Verification channels are deleted 5 seconds after resolution instead of being left locked/renamed
- **Verification — audit trail**: `resolved_by_user_id` and `rejection_reason` columns added to `verification_tickets`
- **`/growthcheckin`**: Optional community sharing (anonymous or named) to a configured growth channel
- **`/growthhistory`**: Paginated view of last 15 check-ins with full detail modal and per-entry deletion
- **`/config growth set_channel`**: Configure the community growth channel with optional channel picker

#### Bug Fixes
- **Verification AI pipeline**: `ask_gpt_vision` now respects the caller's explicit model — guild `gpt.model` setting was overriding to a text-only model, silently breaking all image analysis
- **Verification AI pipeline**: Fixed content types `input_image`/`input_text` → `image_url`/`text` (xAI chat completions format); images were never reaching the model
- **Default vision model**: Updated to `grok-4-1-fast-reasoning` (`grok-2-vision-latest` deprecated)

  - Shared reflections are now available for user-self AI flows (such as `/growthcheckin`) without leaking into ticket admin suggestions
- **Legal Update Notifications:**
  - New webhook `POST /webhooks/legal-update` and workflow automation to post legal update embeds when ToS or Privacy docs change
- **New `/innersync` Command:**
  - Informational command with official Innersync platform links

#### Security & Reliability
- Reflection privacy boundary tightened: ticket "Suggest reply" excludes reflection context
- Legal and reflection webhook handling follows HMAC signature validation patterns

#### Developer Experience
- Version references updated to `3.1.0` in docs
- Changelog reorganized with a fresh `[Unreleased]` section

## [3.0.0] - 2026-03-09 - "Enterprise Ready"

### 🎉 Major Release: Premium Monetization, Security Framework & Production Infrastructure

This release delivers an enterprise-grade Discord bot with complete monetization, a hardened security framework, universal database helpers, GDPR compliance, and production-ready observability.

#### What's New
- **Premium Monetization Ecosystem:**
  - Full subscription platform with multi-tier pricing (€4.99/mo, €29/year, €49/lifetime) and automated guild assignment
  - Commands: `/premium`, `/premium_check`, `/my_premium`, `/premium_transfer` — one active subscription per user, transferable between servers
  - Early Bird Founder Program: special lifetime tier (€29) with automatic founder role and welcome messaging
  - Core-API integration with HMAC validation, fallback mechanisms, and transfer sync across guilds
- **Universal Database Helpers:**
  - Centralized `DatabaseManager` class (`utils/database_helpers.py`) used across 14 cogs
  - `acquire_safe()` for consistent, safe database access with automatic pool management and error recovery
  - Eliminates connection pool errors, "Future exception was never retrieved" warnings, and timeouts
- **Advanced Security Framework:**
  - Admin credentials via environment variables (`OWNER_IDS`, `ADMIN_ROLE_IDS`) — no hardcoded credentials
  - HMAC webhook validation, OAuth credential security, comprehensive rate limiting
  - Input sanitization across all user inputs (injection, prompt jailbreaks, malicious URLs)
- **GDPR Compliance Suite:**
  - Terms acceptance flow with database persistence; new `terms_acceptance` table (Alembic 006)
  - Data retention policies (7 years for tax compliance), user data export capabilities
- **Join Role (temporary):** Assign a role on join; removed after onboarding completion or verification (`onboarding.join_role_id`, `/config onboarding set_join_role`).
- **Observability:** Dashboard metrics include `premium_metrics` (premium checks, cache hits, transfers, cache size); `/release` command reads release notes from GitHub with link to full notes (`GITHUB_REPO` env).
- **New `/innersync` Command:** Informational command showing Innersync platform details and official links (Core, App, Pricing) with ephemeral response.

#### Technical Improvements
- **Command Structure:** `requires_owner()` decorator for true owner-only commands vs admin-accessible features
- **Embed & Response Consistency:** Unified embed styling; exports use shared CSV helpers and English-only responses
- **Cache Management:** LRU caches with size limits, TTL, and cleanup across settings, cooldowns, rate limits, command stats
- **Premium UX:** After accepting Terms & Privacy in `/premium`, users immediately see the full pricing embed with checkout buttons

#### Bug Fixes

- **Premium:** Fixed guild assignment, checkout URL generation, transfer sync, founder role edge cases
- **Internationalization:** Removed remaining Dutch strings in reminders, inviteboard, dataquery, embed_watcher
- **Exports:** Fixed interaction flow (no `send_error` before `defer()`) in `/export_tickets` and `/export_faq`
- **Syntax & Permissions:** Corrected indentation/imports and admin vs owner permission logic

#### Security
- Credential management via env vars; HMAC validation; IP-based rate limiting; guild-specific access controls
- Input sanitization; data isolation; enhanced audit logging

#### Performance
- Database pool recycling, health checks, optimized query patterns
- Cache optimization, background task lifecycle, memory leak prevention, graceful shutdown

#### Migration
- Zero downtime deployment; backwards compatibility; data integrity validation; rollback-safe migration paths

## [2.1.0] - 2026-02-09 - "Lifecycle Manager"

### Google Cloud Secret Manager & docs

- **Secret Manager:** Google Drive credentials load from Secret Manager in production with env fallback for local dev (`utils/gcp_secrets.py`). Correct env var `GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_JSON` for fallback; optional `return_source` for accurate logging.
- **Drive/lifecycle:** Drive verification at startup runs in a thread to avoid blocking; Drive client init is thread-safe.
- **Docs:** Security guide (`docs/SECURITY.md`), credentials setup (`docs/GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_SETUP.md`), Railway Secret Manager (`docs/RAILWAY_SECRET_MANAGER_SETUP.md`). README restructured; Operational Playbook in `docs/OPERATIONAL_PLAYBOOK.md`.
