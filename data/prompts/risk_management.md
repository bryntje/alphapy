Risk management is the process of protecting your capital while trading.  
It includes setting stop-losses, calculating position sizes, and avoiding overexposure.  
Good risk management helps you stay consistent, even when trades donâ€™t go your way.  
Without it, even a strong strategy can fail in the long run.
