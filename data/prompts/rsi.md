RSI stands for Relative Strength Index.  
Itâ€™s a momentum indicator used to identify if an asset is overbought or oversold.  
A reading above 70 usually suggests the asset may be overbought, while below 30 indicates it could be oversold.  
Traders use RSI to anticipate potential reversals or confirm ongoing trends.
